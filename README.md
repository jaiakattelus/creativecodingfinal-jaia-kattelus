This is my final code for my volleyball game, it's pretty messy and I couldnt figure out how to make the ball
physics make more sense. Maybe if I just made the ball automatically bounce off the players instead of having to hit the ball.
Controls: Serve the ball with "s" hit the ball with "d" and jump with the space bar.
